I live in metropolitan Western Australia, and I have Albinism. A common precipitation of Albinism is visual impairment. I am legally blind, with a visual acuity of 6/60, as measured by a Snellen Chart. As such, I can't drive.

Recently I've become aware of 'bioptics', an obvious-in-hindsight visual aid which increases ones visual acuity by allowing them to selectively/momentarily use a magnifying lens in addition to their regular eyeglasses. To avoid not burying the lede, this has been used in a large number cases to allow someone with a significant visual impairment to drive.

Despite bioptics having supposedly been around for decades in the US, it's taken me—someone that's regularly seen optometrists, ophthalmologists, and occupational therapists my entire life—until my mid-20s to come across them in a Facebook group.

It seems to be very early days for bioptics in Australia. As such, I saw value in sharing my experience—successful or otherwise—as it happens, in hope that it will help others. When possible, I will point to other resources instead of regurgitating information. 

### Acknowledging privilege and bias

I am lucky enough to be a high income earner with stable long-term employment prospects. As this process involves self-advocacy, private healthcare, and travel, I acknowledge that this privilege will influence how I go about the this process. With employment prospects for visually impaired people [as abysmal as they are](https://www.visionaustralia.org/community/news/2019-08-23/survey-shows-blind-people-significantly-underemployed-around-world), I acknowledge that this is less obtainable for some. My hope is to provide enough information that I can help others avoid undue expense, or at least give an indication of the financial and time commitments associated with the process.

### Background information

#### What is a bioptic?

It is important to understand what a bioptic is, physically and functionally. An advocacy/support group for current and potential bioptic users in Australia—Bioptic Drivers Australia—[has a good basic rundown of this](https://www.biopticdriversaus.com/how-it-works).

#### Does it really work?

Supposedly, yes. I was—and remain—deeply skeptical. I feel that I understand the limitations of my vision, and having received shrugs and sorry looks from optometrists my entire life, the prospect of something helping enough to allow me to drive sounds like fiction. Alas, there are [numerous success stories on the Bioptic Drivers Australia website](https://www.biopticdriversaus.com/success-stories). The data-driven skeptic in me thinks that [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) is at play. After all, who's writing a story about how they _weren't_ eligible for a bioptic? I've resolved to give it a shot anyway. 

#### Is it safe?

Seemingly yes. This is a fact that I am still coming to terms with. There's actually been a fair bit of small-scale worldwide research into using bioptics to drive.

> Half of the subjects who entered the bioptic training program passed the official fitness to drive test, demonstrating that they could drive smoothly and safely in Dutch traffic using a bioptic telescope system.
