I live in metropolitan Western Australia, and I have Albinism. A common precipitation of Albinism is visual impairment. I am legally blind, with a visual acuity of 6/60 (metres), as measured by a Snellen Chart. As such, I am legally disallowed from obtaining a drivers license, and for good reason! 

Recently I've become aware of 'bioptics', an obvious-in-hindsight visual aid which increases ones visual acuity by allowing them to selectively/momentarily use a magnifying lens in addition to their regular eyeglasses. To avoid not burying the lede, this has been used in a large number cases to allow someone with a significant visual impairment to drive.

Despite bioptics having supposedly been around for decades in the US, it's taken me—someone that's regularly seen optometrists, ophthalmologists, and occupational therapists my entire life—until my mid-20s to come across them in a Facebook group.

It seems to be very early days for bioptics in Australia. As such, I saw value in sharing my experience—successful or otherwise—as it happens, in hope that it will help others. When possible, I will point to other resources instead of regurgitating information. 

### Acknowledging privilege and bias

I am lucky enough to be a high income earner work stable long-term employment prospects. As this process involves self-advocacy, private healthcare, and travel, I acknowledge that this privilege will influence how I go about the this process. I knowledge that this will be less obtainable for some. My hope is to provide enough information that I can help others avoid undue expense, or at least give an indication of the financial and time commitments associated with the process.

### Background information

It is important to understand what a bioptic is, physically and functionally. An advocacy/support group for current and potential bioptic users in Australia—Bioptic Drivers Australia—[has a good basic rundown of this](https://www.biopticdriversaus.com/how-it-works).
